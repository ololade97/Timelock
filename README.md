# Timelock

The smart contract allows you to lock Ether for as long as you want. You can only withdraw your Ether after the time you set lapses. 
2 minutes is the set time in the contract. You can always change that. 
Two state variables are declared - locktime and balances - using mapping.
Then you have the deposit and withdraw functions.
The comments in the code could be useful - read them.
