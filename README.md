# Timelock

The smart contract allows you to lock Ether for as long as you want. 2 minutes is the set time in the contract but you can always change that. 
Two state variables are declared - locktime and balances - using mapping.
Then you have the deposit and withdraw functions.
The comments in the code could be useful.
